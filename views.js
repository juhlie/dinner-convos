<h3>Manifesto</h3>

<p>
	In 1994, 12 black women coined the term “reproductive justice,” or "the complete physical, mental, spiritual, poitical, social, and economic well-being of women and girls, based on the foll achievement and protection of women’s human rights" as Loretta Ross describes. Fighting against reproductive oppression and misinformation is essential for our liberation.
</p>

<p>
	In 2021, <a href="#background">6 women of color</a> were brought together by their shared interest in reproductive justice at the <a href="https://www.ourfeministfutures.com/" target="_blank">Feminist Future(s) Hackathon</a>—Tia, Julie, Krithika, Dina, Althea and Tanvi. We believe in the power of healthy conversations to plant seeds for change. Conversations for Every Dinner  Table is a resource that reframes traditionally taboo and stigmatized topics related to reproductive processes so we can feel comfortable talking about them openly, learn from one another’s lived experiences, and have fun. By the end of the game, we hope that players can feel more connected with their own bodies as well as others’, more equipped to step outside of the oppressive narrative framework, and more confident in defining our own criteria of normalcy and care.
</p>

<p>
  Start a meaningful conversation by picking a card.

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
As the title suggests, Conversations for Every Dinner Table is suitable for intimate or social group gatherings. Conversations may take place among groups of 2 - 7 people of friends and families, between generations, and across genders. With the presence of a mediator, this game can be used to facilitate educational public programs, such as school workshops, public library offerings, or Trivia Night at local bars, using the digital version (currently work-in-progress). If there is a use case you’d like to suggest or discuss with us, please feel free to send an email to <a href="mailto:ffrj2021@googlegroups.com">ffrj2021@googlegroups.com</a>. 
</p>

<p>
There are 2 types of cards to draw from in this deck: Prompt Cards and Key Cards. First, separate the Prompt Cards and Key Cards into 2 separate decks.
</p>

<h3>PROMPT CARDS</h3>

<p>
Prompt Cards invite responses from players, starting a conversation. They are divided into seven topic categories: 
</p>

<p>
Postpartum | Menstruation | Pregnancy | Menopause | Sex | Abortion | Reproductive Health 
</p>

<h3>KICKING OFF THE GAME</h3>

<p>
At the beginning of the game, each player draws seven Prompt Cards, one from each category. Alternatively, for a quicker game, shuffle all the categories together and ask each player to draw only four Prompt Cards. 
</p>

<p>
Any player can volunteer to kick off the game by picking one of their cards and reading the prompt written on the card out loud to the group. Some prompts will ask the player to answer a question, while others may instruct the player to draw something or share a story. Below are the types of prompts:
</p>

<p>
Answer a Question | Reflect | Guess | Think Wildly | Draw | Tell A Story
</p>

<p>
The player will respond to the prompt first, then invite other players from the group to respond to it, creating a conversation. 
</p>

<h3>KEY CARDS</h3>
<p>
If a player finds it difficult to come up with an answer or the conversation experiences hiccups, draw a Key Card to help move the dialogue forward. They are:
</p>

<p>
Mirror | Silence | Swap | Speculative | Affirmation 
<br>
Think Positively | Listen Deeply | Sit In Stillness
</p>

<h3>MOVING ON</h3>

<p>
Once all the players agree to move on from the first Prompt Card, the next player (your choice of clockwise, counterclockwise, or popcorn) will continue by reading out one card of their choice.
</p>

<h3>EXIT</h3>

<p>
You do not have to finish discussing all the cards in order for this game to end. Like other dinner table conversations, this one is not rigid either.
</p>

<h3>Community Guidelines</h3>
<p>
It is important to hold conversations that are respectful, thought-provoking, and most importantly safe. Safety in a conversation means not just being heard, but the words that are used do not cause more harm to those who are systematically left behind: people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, women, and many others intersectional identities that are usually not heard. Here are some community guidelines that can support healthy and fruitful conversations and are not meant to harm or pass judgment, but uplift and spread joy and safety. Take some time to read these together and propose additional guidelines you think would help you feel open to the possibilities of new conversations.
</p>

---

<ul>
<li>
This game is intended to hold a safe space to discuss topics related to our bodies and broader reproductive justice.
</li>

<li>
Be kind to yourself and other people while playing this game, and beyond. Sometimes harm can be unintentional, but impact is greater than intention - it is essential to acknowledge harm, discuss how it could be avoided, and help the person learn how to avoid unkindness in the future (even beyond this game!)
</li>

<li>
Everyone playing this game should be a part of the conversation and have their voice heard should they wish to contribute. At the same time, players should feel free to skip questions, choose not to share, or decide to leave the game at any moment during the course of a game. 
</li>

<li>
Active, open discussion is welcome. However, silence is also valid and welcome as a moment of deep engagement and reflection.
</li>

<li>
View uncomfortable feelings -- your own or observed from others -- with tenderness and care.
</li>

<li>
Some conversations take courage. Acknowledge that courage by agreeing to keep the conversations discussed during gameplay private and not to be repeated without permission from other players. 
</li>

<li>
To help everyone enjoy the conversation, keep in mind the following when you contribute your thoughts or answers: 

<ul>
<li>
Avoid defamatory, indecent, offensive, profane, discriminatory, misleading, unlawful or threatening language. 
</li>

<li>
Personal attacks, name-calling, trolling and abuse will not be acceptable and require an apology.
</li>

<li>
Different viewpoints are welcome. Respect that other people playing this game have had different life experiences and may have a different perspective to yours.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Ask the group if there are any other guidelines that players want to establish before playing the game.
</li>
</ul>
